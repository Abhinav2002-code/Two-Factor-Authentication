# Two-Factor-Authentication


An RFID or radio frequency identification system consists of two main components, a
tag attached to the object to be identified, and a reader that reads the tag.
A reader consists of a radio frequency module and an antenna that generates a high
frequency electromagnetic field. Whereas the tag is usually a passive device (it does
not have a battery). It consists of a microchip that stores and processes information,
and an antenna for receiving and transmitting a signal.
When the tag is brought close to the reader, the reader generates an electromagnetic
field. This causes electrons to move through the tagâ€™s antenna and subsequently
powers the chip.
The chip then responds by sending its stored information back to the reader in the
form of another radio signal. This is called a backscatter. The reader detects and
interprets this backscatter and sends the data to a computer or microcontroller.
